          <p>
            My name is Juan Carlos Gonzalez. I am 26 years old, and I live in Charlotte, NC. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Though new to web development, I am currently a full-stack web developer in training. In 2012, while attending Central Piedmont Community College, I had the opportunity to delve into a few programming languages such as C++, Python and Java. Since then, I have forgotten the particulars of the languages, but I remember the basics of the craft. I liked programming because it was a great intellectual challenge that pushed me to think in a different way, to look at things from a different perspective.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the age of 16, I started to practice Aikido, a relatively modern Japanese martial arts, at a local dojo, or “martial arts training place. ”Since then, the study of martial arts, both in its philosophical and tactical aspects, has been at the core of my life. I’ve also had the chance of practicing some Kendo and traditional Japanese Ju-Jutsu. In Japanese, the word "Ju-Jutsu" is composed of two characters, which together can mean "soft technique." 
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am attending the Coding BootCamp at UNC Charlotte, until August, 2017. By the end of this course, I hope to be familiar enough with web tools and modern web programming languages to comfortably work on front-end and back end development. Through experience, I aspire to become an able and proficient full stack web developer.
