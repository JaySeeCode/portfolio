          <p>
            My name is Juan Carlos Gonzalez. I am 27years old, and I live in Charlotte, NC. Originally, I was born in Ecuador, South America, in a city by the coast called Guayaquil. When I was 15, my father decided to move his business, along with the family, to the United States. Naturally, I emigrated along. Most of my formative years where thus spent in the U.S.

            At the age of 16, I started to practice Aikido, a relatively modern Japanese martial art, at a local dojo, or “martial arts training place.” Since then, the study of martial arts, both in its philosophical and tactical aspects, have been at the core of my life. I have been diligently studying and practicing Aikido for 11 years now, and I’ve also had the chance of practicing some Kendo and traditional Japanese Ju-Jutsu. In Japanese, the word "Ju-Jutsu" is composed of two characters, which together simply mean "soft technique."

            Currently, I am a full-stack web developer in training. That sounds very serious and legitimate, but to be honest, I am new to web development. Nonetheless, I am very eager and hopeful about the prospect this newly adopted career offers. A couple of years ago, while attending Central Piedmont Community College (in Charlotte, NC), I had the opportunity of delving into programming languages such as C++, Python and Java. That is when my interest in programming was born. I enjoyed it very much, as it was a great intellectual challenge. Also, it seemed to me very much like solving puzzles.
